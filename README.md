# About

The goal of this repository is to explore alternative stylesheets for [PML], the Practical Markup Language lightweight syntax by [Christian Neumanns].

I had attempted a similar project before, as part of the **[PML Playground]** project, which included a [stylesheets sub-project] (among others), but it soon became too cumbersome to maintain a single shared build script for all its projects, especially due to the frequent breaking changes of PML updates. Also, many of the sub-projects in the **PML Playground** have gone stale, for one reason or another.

So I've now moved the old **PML Style Sheets** project to this new dedicated repository, which will replace it entirely.
